# TwitterClone

In this project, a twitter clone project has been developed.

On the homepage, tweets previously posted by users are sorted by date of creation. If the user is logged in, the previously posted tweets are listed on the home page and they can post a new tweet with a form. In the details of the tweet, there is the creation date of the tweet, the information by which user posted the tweet, the information on how many likes it received, and a link that will display the tweet separately.
